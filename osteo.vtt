00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.747
<v ->We're gonna go through some ranges of motion</v>

2
00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:22.110
so I can get a better idea about how well

3
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.560
you're able to love, okay?

4
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.393
<v ->Okay.</v>

5
00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:25.226
<v ->Can you turn your head as far to the right</v>

6
00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.388
as you possibly can?

7
00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:27.221
Okay.

8
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.890
And turn your head as far to the left as you can.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.840
Good, and look back at me.

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.180
Drop your head forward as far as you can.

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.013
Good.

12
00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.850
And drop your head backwards as far as you can.

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.258
Fantastic.

14
00:00:41.258 --> 00:00:43.620
I want you to take your arms, come out to the side

15
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.063
and go straight up over your head as far as you can go.

16
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.790
Come all the way up.

17
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.190
Thank you.

18
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.410
Thank you.

19
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.243
This one hurts?

20
00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:53.076
<v ->Yes.</v>

21
00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:54.040
<v ->Can I raise it up a little farther?</v>

22
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.873
<v ->It hurts.</v>

23
00:00:54.873 --> 00:00:56.670
<v ->Okay, bring your arms straight back down.</v>

24
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.720
Thank you.

25
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.080
Now I want you to bring your arms forward

26
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.663
right up over your head as far as you're able to go.

27
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.930
So we can get that other one up.

28
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.991
Can I raise this one up higher?

29
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.824
<v ->It hurts.</v>

30
00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:08.657
<v ->That hurts to do?</v>

31
00:01:08.657 --> 00:01:10.110
Okay, bring your arms back down.

32
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.943
Can I have you put your arms straight behind your back?

33
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.830
Okay. And if I try and bring that one back

34
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.788
that one hurts to do.

35
00:01:21.788 --> 00:01:22.810
That hurts too.
<v ->Okay.</v>

36
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.220
And come back.

37
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.200
Thank you.

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.660
Okay, you can put your hands down.

39
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.124
I want you to take this hand and reach behind your head.

40
00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.630
Are you able to do that just fine?

41
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.678
And bring it back down.

42
00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:35.285
And take this hand and try and reach up if you can.

43
00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:36.801
Too much to do?
<v ->Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:38.270
<v ->Okay, and come down.</v>

45
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.300
I want you to take this hand and come behind your back

46
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.200
if you're able to.

47
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.340
Fantastic.

48
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.880
And come back.

49
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
Are you able to put this arm behind you?

50
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.400
Okay.

51
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.740
Kind of gets stuck a little bit.

52
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.870
<v ->Yeah, it hurts.</v>

53
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.617
I mean I can push it but it hurts.

54
00:01:54.617 --> 00:01:56.670
<v ->No need to push it, come on back.</v>

55
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.033
Thank you, all right.
